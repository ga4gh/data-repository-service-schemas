          The Data Bundle checksum is computed over a sorted concatenation of all the 
          checksums within the top-level 'contents' of the Bundle (not recursive). The list of Data
          Object checksums are sorted alphabetically (hex-code) before concatenation and a further
          checksum performed on the concated binary value. Example below:
          Data Ojects:
            md5(DO1) = 72794b6d30bc86d92e40a1aa65c880b8
            md5(DO2) = 5e089d29a18954e68a78ee6a3c6edabd
          Data Bundle:
          DB1 = md5( concat( sort( md5(DO1), md5(DO2) ) ) )
              = md5( concat( sort( 72794b6d30bc86d92e40a1aa65c880b8, 5e089d29a18954e68a78ee6a3c6edabd ) ) )
