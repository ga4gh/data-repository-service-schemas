            If false and the object_id refers to a bundle, then the ContentsObject array
            contains only those objects directly contained in the bundle. That is, if the
            bundle contains other bundles, those other bundles are not recursively
            included in the result.

            If true and the object_id refers to a bundle, then the entire set of objects
            in the bundle is expanded. That is, if the bundle contains other bundles,
            then those other bundles are recursively expanded and included in the result.
            Recursion continues through the entire sub-tree of the bundle.

            If the object_id refers to a blob, then the query parameter is ignored.
