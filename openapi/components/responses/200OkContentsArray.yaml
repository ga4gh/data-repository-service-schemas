      Pagination links to retrieve the `contents` array of a DRS Object bundle via paginated traversal.

      #### Link header structure

      The value of the `Link` header is a **comma-delimited** list of entries. Each entry in the list contains:
      1. A URL that clients can request to obtain a new subset of `contents` for the same DRS Object
      2. A `rel` (relation) keyword, indicating the direction of traversal (e.g. next page, previous page, etc.)

      The correct format for a pagination link is as follows: 

      `<{url}>; rel="{rel_keyword}"`

      i.e.:
      * The URL must be encapsulated in angle brackets
      * The `rel` keyword must be preceded by an explicit `rel=` indicator and encapsulated in double quotes
      * The URL and `rel` keyword must be separated by `; `

      #### `rel` keywords

      Standardized `rel` keywords inform the client of the traversal direction of each URL in the `Link` header, enabling dynamic traversal. The following table outlines the acceptable `rel` keywords and what they mean:

      | `rel` keyword | description |
      |-------------|-------------|
      | next | URL retrieves the next page of `contents` objects compared to the current page the client is on |
      | prev | URL retrieves the previous page of `contents` objects compared to the current page the client is on |
      | first | URL jumps to the first page of `contents` objects |
      | last | URL jumps to the final page of `contents` objects |

      Only `rel="next"` links are mandatory for unidirectional traversal. The other `rel` links are optional, and can be left up to individual implementers if they wish to enable multidirectional traversal for their DRS service.

      #### Example Link header

      The following snippet displays an example `Link` header value for paginated traversal. In the example, the client most recently obtained page `14` of `contents` objects for the DRS Object with an ID of `314159`, out of a total `34` pages.

      ```
      Link: <https://drs.example.org/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/314159/contents?page=15>; rel="next",
      <https://drs.example.org/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/314159/contents?page=34>; rel="last",
      <https://drs.example.org/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/314159/contents?page=1>; rel="first",
      <https://drs.example.org/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/314159/contents?page=13>; rel="prev"
      ```
