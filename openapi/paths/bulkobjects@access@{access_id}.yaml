  summary: Get URLs for fetching bytes from multiple objects
  description: >-
    Returns an array of URL objects that can be used to fetch the bytes of multiple `DrsObject`s.

    This method only needs to be called when using an `AccessMethod` that contains an `access_id`
    (e.g., for servers that use signed URLs for fetching object bytes).
