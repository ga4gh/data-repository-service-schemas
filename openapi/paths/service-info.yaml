    Returns information about the DRS service

    Extends the
    [v1.0.0 GA4GH Service Info specification](https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-info)
    as the standardized format for GA4GH web services to self-describe.

    According to the 
    [service-info type registry](https://github.com/ga4gh/TASC/blob/master/service-info/ga4gh-service-info.json)
    maintained by the [Technical Alignment Sub Committee (TASC)](https://github.com/ga4gh/TASC),
    a DRS service MUST have:
      * a `type.group` value of `org.ga4gh`
      * a `type.artifact` value of `drs`
    
    e.g.
    ```
    {
        "id": "com.example.drs",
        "description": "Serves data according to DRS specification",
        ...
        "type": {
            "group": "org.ga4gh",
            "artifact": "drs"
        }
        ...
    }
    ```

    See the [Service Registry Appendix](#tag/GA4GH-Service-Registry) for more information on how to register a DRS service with a service registry.
