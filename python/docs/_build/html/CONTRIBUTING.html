<p>Thank you for taking the time to contribute. We appreciate it!</p>
<p>The GA4GH schemas define an API for sharing genomic and phenotypic data.</p>
<p>There are two ways to contribute to the effort - via issues, which are
used for discussion, and pull requests, which are concrete proposals of
change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issues">
<span id="issues"></span><h1>Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The project's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ga4gh/ga4gh-schemas/issues">Issues
Page</a> is a forum to
discuss both major and minor issues related to developing the standards,
formats, and APIs. It also serves as the means for collaborating with
the group and discussing contributions that will ultimately lead to
changes to the formats and APIs. See the <a class="reference external" href="#issue_resolution">Issue</a>
section below for specifics on how issues are resolved by the community.
Examples of the type of issues that can be submitted are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Identify use cases that will shape the standards and APIs</li>
<li>How to add or delete objects and/or object attributes</li>
<li>How a particular attribute should be defined</li>
<li>Report bugs you encounter when using the reference implementations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pull-requests">
<span id="pull-requests"></span><h1>Pull Requests<a class="headerlink" href="#pull-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The way to contribute development effort and code to the project is via
GitHub pull requests. GitHub provides a nice <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">overview on how to create
a pull
request</a>.
Contributions typically require pull requests to each of the schemas,
server and compliance repositories, although pull requests to the server
may merely improve the code without affecting the API, and therefore
changing the schemas or compliance tests. A set of branches across the
repositories each with the same name is a branch set, e.g. the master
branch in each repository forms the master branch set.</p>
<p>Some general rules to follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">Fork</a> the main
project into your personal GitHub space to work on.</li>
<li>Create a branch for each update that you're working on. These
branches are often called &quot;feature&quot; or &quot;topic&quot; branches. Any changes
that you push to your feature branch will automatically be shown in
the pull request.</li>
<li>If necessary, replicate the last two steps' fork-and-branch process
for each of the compliance and server repositories to create a
branch set - each constituent repository branch will be
identically named.</li>
<li>Coordinate pull requests across the branch set by making them as
simultaneously as possible, and <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23019608/github-commit-syntax-to-link-a-pull-request-issue">cross referencing
them</a>.</li>
<li>Keep your pull requests as small as possible. Large pull requests
are hard to review. Try to break up your changes into self-contained
and incremental pull requests.</li>
<li>The first line of commit messages should be a short (<p>&amp;lt;</p>
80
character) summary, followed by an empty line and then any details
that you want to share about the commit.</li>
<li>Please try to follow the <a class="reference external" href="#syntax_style">existing syntax style</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you submit or change your pull request, the Travis build system
will automatically run tests to ensure valid schema syntax. If your pull
request fails to pass tests, review the test log, make changes and then
push them to your feature branch to be tested again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issue-resolution">
<span id="issue-resolution"></span><h1>Issue Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-resolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Once a pull request or issue have been submitted, anyone can comment or
vote on to express their opinion following the Apache voting system.
Quick summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>+1</strong> something you agree with</li>
<li><strong>-1</strong> if you have a strong objection to an issue, which will be
taken very seriously. A -1 vote should provide an
alternative solution.</li>
<li><strong>+0</strong> or <strong>-0</strong> for neutral comments or weak opinions.</li>
<li>It's okay to have input without voting</li>
<li>Silence gives assent</li>
</ul>
<p>A pull request with at least two <strong>+1</strong> votes, no <strong>-1</strong> votes, that has
been open for at least 3 days, and whose cross-referenced pull requests
to server and compliance have similarly been upvoted is ready to be
merged. The merge should be done by someone from a different
organization than the submitter. (We sometimes waive the 3 days for
cosmetic-only changes -- use good judgment.) A pull request to either
the schemas, servers or compliance repository that involves changes to
the others should not be merged without coordinating, mergable pull
requests to the other repositories. Conversely, when merging a pull
request the other pull requests in the branch set must be merged at the
same time (In practise, when merging a branch set including the schemas
repository, merge the pull request to schemas first to avoid the
continuous integration build issues). If an issue gets any <strong>-1</strong> votes,
the comments on the issue need to reach consensus before the issue can
be resolved one way or the other. There isn't any strict time limit on a
contentious issue.</p>
<p>The project will strive for full consensus on everything until it runs
into a problem with this model.</p>

<span id="syntax-style-and-conventions"></span><h1>Syntax Style and Conventions<a class="headerlink" href="#syntax-style-and-conventions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The current code conventions for the source files are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Follow the <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style">protocol buffers style
guide</a></li>
<li>Use two-space indentation, and no tabs.</li>
<li>Hard-wrap code to 80 characters per line.</li>
<li>Comments may use

mark up.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<span id="documentation"></span><h1>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The goal of GA4GH is to define an interoperable API specification. To
achieve this, the intent, rationale, and semantics of all data objects
and operations need to be clearly and precisely defined. Decisions that
are not captured in documentation are lost.</p>
<p>All schemas defined in GA4GH must include normative documentation. This
should consist of overview and design documentation as well as
documentation in the schemas. This documentation should explain the
goals, overall design, and rationale for decisions that were made. It
must be addressed to both client and server developer audiences. It may
cite published papers or stable web documentation.</p>
<p>Overview documentation should be in ReStructuredText markdown format
(*.rst) in the doc/source/ directory. This format was chosen for
inclusion in a Sphinx-based documentation system that is under
development. Graphics are encouraged and should have a source to
drawings in SVG format that will be converted to PNG by the
documentation build.</p>
<p>Developers are encouraged to get feedback on design documentation before
developing and implementing schemas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="topic-branches">
<span id="topic-branches"></span><h1>Topic Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#topic-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If you wish to collaborate on a new feature with other GA4GH members you
can ask that a topic branch set be created. This will generally involve
the creation of identically named topic branches for each of the schema,
compliance and server repositories. Since Github does not allow pull
requests against branches that do not yet exist, you will have to create
an issue asking for the topic branch set to be created.</p>
<p>Once a topic branch set exists, pull requests can be made against it in
the usual way. It may also be brought up to date with new changes merged
into master by anyone with commit access, if the changes produce merely
a fast-forward merge for each constituent branch. However, if changes
from the master branch create a new merge commit in or or more of the
repositories, that commit needs to be reviewed in a pull request.</p>
<p>Changes made in a topic branch set can be merged into master by creating
and then <a class="reference external" href="#issue_resolution">resolving in the normal way</a> a pull request
against the master branch set, irrespective of ownership by a task-team
(see below) or not.</p>
<p>Topic branch sets that have been merged into master and that are no
longer being developed upon should be
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blog/1335-tidying-up-after-pull-requests">deleted</a>
(they will still appear in the git history), this can be achieved by
consensus of those working on the topic branch set, e.g. a specific
task-team.</p>
<div class="section" id="task-team-topic-branch-sets">
<span id="task-team-topic-branch-sets"></span><h2>Task Team Topic Branch Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#task-team-topic-branch-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Frequently topic branch sets are developed by members working within a
task team of the <a class="reference external" href="http://ga4gh.org">Data Working Group</a>. Topic branch
sets developed by a task team should be prefixed with the task team's
name followed by a dash, e.g. reads-foo, refVar-bar. To enable speedy
development, task-teams may set their own rules for contribution to the
topic branch sets they own. This allows task-teams to develop features
in the view of the larger group, while potentially being unencumbered by
the more lengthy process of standard <a class="reference external" href="#issue%20resolution">issue
resolution</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-branches">
<span id="release-branches"></span><h1>Release Branches<a class="headerlink" href="#release-branches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>From time to time the group will make a release. This is achieved by
creating a branch set including all the repositories named
&quot;release-foo&quot;, where foo is the release name. Only bug fixes are allowed
to release branch sets. To refer to a specific version of a release
branch set either the commit id can be used, or alternatively (better),
a tag can be created (which should be replicated across repositories).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="retired-task-teams">
<span id="retired-task-teams"></span><h1>Retired Task Teams<a class="headerlink" href="#retired-task-teams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As projects mature, the need to have a standing <a class="reference external" href="http://ga4gh.org">Data Working
Group</a> task team with regular teleconferences and
meetings will decline. Mature task teams will enter a *maintenance mode
which will entail the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A task team chair will be appointed to regularly review the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ga4gh#schemas</span></code> Github Issues for issue that would effect the
outcomes of the retired task team.</li>
<li>The task team chair will tag those issues with the retired
group's label.</li>
<li>Minor pull requests (e.g. documentation enhancements) would follow
the same <a class="reference external" href="#issue_resolution">issue resolution</a> process as
outlined above.</li>
<li>Major pull requeusts (e.g. API additions or changes) would be
additionally labeled 'major change', and the retired task team chair
will reach out to that list of DWG members and request comment on
the issue.</li>
</ul>
