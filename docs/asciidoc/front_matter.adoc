== Introduction

The Data Repository Service (DRS) API provides a generic interface to data repositories so data consumers, including workflow systems, can access data in a single, standard way regardless of where it's stored and how it's managed. This document describes the DRS API and provides details on the specific endpoints, request formats, and response.  It is intended for developers of DRS-compatible services and of clients that will call these DRS services.

The primary functionality of DRS is to map a logical ID to a means for physically retrieving the data represented by the ID. The sections below describe the characteristics of those IDs, the types of data supported, and how the mapping works.

== DRS API Principles

=== DRS IDs

Each implementation of DRS can choose its own id scheme, as long as it follows these guidelines:

* DRS IDs are URL-safe text strings made up of alphanumeric characters and any of [.-_/]
* One DRS ID MUST always return the same object data (or, in the case of a collection, the same set of objects). This constraint aids with reproducibility.
* DRS does NOT support semantics around multiple versions of an object. (For example, there’s no notion of “get latest version” or “list all versions” in DRS v1.) Individual implementation MAY choose an ID scheme that includes version hints.
* DRS implementations MAY have more than one ID that maps to the same object.

=== DRS Datatypes

DRS v1 supports two datatypes:

* Blobs -- these are file-like objects
* Collections -- these are sets of other DRS objects (either Blobs or Collections)

=== Read-only

DRS v1 is a read-only API. We expect that each implementation will define its own mechanisms and interfaces (graphical and/or programmatic) for adding and updating data.

=== URI convention (WORK IN PROGRESS)

For convenience, we define a recommended syntax for fully referencing DRS-accessible objects. Strings of the form drs://<server>/<id> mean “make a DRS call to the HTTP address at <server>, passing in the DRS id <id>, to retrieve the object”. For example, these strings are useful when passing objects to a WES server for processing. 

=== Standards

The DRS API specification is written in OpenAPI and embodies a RESTful service philosophy.  It uses JSON in requests and responses and standard HTTP/HTTPS for information transport.

== Authorization & Authentication (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Users must supply credentials that establish their identity and authorization in order to use a DRS endpoint. We recommend that DRS implementations use an OAuth2 https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/[bearer token], although they can choose other mechanisms if appropriate. DRS callers can use the `auth_instructions_url` from the https://ga4gh.github.io/data-repository-service-schemas/#/DataRepositoryService/GetServiceInfo[service-info endpoint] to learn how to obtain and use a bearer token for a particular implementation.

The DRS implementation is responsible for checking that a user is authorized to submit requests. The particular authorization policy is up to the DRS implementer.
