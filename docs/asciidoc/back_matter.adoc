== Appendix: Compact Identifier-Based URIs

Compact identifiers refer to locally-unique persistent identifiers that have been namespaced to provide global uniqueness. See https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/101279v3["Uniform resolution of compact identifiers for biomedical data"] for an excellent introduction to this topic.  By using compact identifiers in DRS URIs, along with a resolver registry (identifiers.org/n2t.net), systems can identify the current resolver when they need to translate a DRS URI into a fetchable URL. This allows a project to issue compact identifiers in DRS URIs and not be concerned if the project name or DRS hostname changes in the future, the current resolver can always be found through the identifiers.org/n2t.net registries.  Together the identifiers.org/n2t.net systems support the resolver lookup for over 700 compact identifiers formats used in the research community, making it possible for a DRS server to use any of these as DRS IDs (or to register a new compact identifier resolver service of their own).

We use a DRS URI scheme rather than https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE[Compact URIs (CURIEs)] directly since we feel that systems consuming DRS objects will be able to better differentiate a DRS URI.  CURIEs are widely used in the research community and we felt the fact that they can point to a wide variety of entities (HTML documents, PDFs, identities in data models, etc), making it more difficult for systems to unambiguously identify entities as DRS objects.

Still, to make compact identifiers work in DRS URIs we leverage the CURIE format used by identifiers.org/n2t.net.  Compact identifiers have the form:

    prefix:accession

The prefix can be divided into an optional `provider_code` and `namespace`.  The `accession` here is an Ark, DOI, Data GUID, or another issuers's local ID for the object being pointed to:

    [provider_code/]namespace:accession

Both the `provider_code` and `namespace` disallow spaces or punctuation, only lowercase alphanumerical characters, underscores and dots are allowed.

https://n2t.net/e/compact_ids.html[Examples] include (from n2t.net):

		PDB:2gc4
		Taxon:9606
		DOI:10.5281/ZENODO.1289856
		ark:/47881/m6g15z54
		IGSN:SSH000SUA

TIP: DRS URIs using compact identifiers with resolvers registered in identifiers.org/n2t.net can be distinguished from the hostname-based DRS URIs below based on the required ":" which is not allowed in hostname-based URI.

TIP: The CURIE format used by identifiers.org/n2t.net does not percent-encode reserved URI characters but, instead, relies on the first ":" character to separate prefix from accession. Since these accessions can contain any characters, and characters like "/" will interfere with DRS API calls, you _must_ percent encode the accessions extracted from DRS compact identifier-based URIs when using as DRS IDs in DRS GET requests.  For more information see the Note "DRS Client Compact Identifier-Based URI Resolution Process".

See the documentation on https://n2t.net/e/compact_ids.html[n2t.net] and https://docs.identifiers.org/[identifiers.org] for much more information on the compact identifiers used there and details about the resolution process.

.Note: DRS Client Compact Identifier-Based URI Resolution Process
****
A DRS client identifies the a DRS URI compact identifier components using the first occurance of "/" (optional) and ":" characters. These are not allowed inside the provider_code (optional) or the namespace. The ":" character is not allowed in a Hostname-based DRS URI, providing a convenient mechanism to differentiate them. Once the provider_code (optional) and namespace are extracted from a DRS compact identifier-based URI, a client can use services on identifiers.org to identify available resolvers.

_Let's look at a specific example DRS compact identifier-based URI that uses DOIs, a popular compact identifier, and walk through the process that a client would use to resolve it._  Starting with the DRS URI:

    drs://doi:10.5072/FK2805660V

with a namespace of "doi", the following GET request will return information about the namespace:

    GET https://registry.api.identifiers.org/restApi/namespaces/search/findByPrefix?prefix=doi[https://registry.api.identifiers.org/restApi/namespaces/search/findByPrefix?prefix=doi]

This information then points to resolvers for the "doi" namespace (this "doi" namespace was assigned a namespace ID of 75 by identifiers.org, this "id" has nothing to do with compact identifier accessions or DRS IDs):

    GET https://registry.api.identifiers.org/restApi/resources/search/findAllByNamespaceId?id=75[https://registry.api.identifiers.org/restApi/resources/search/findAllByNamespaceId?id=75]

This returns enough information to, ultimately, identify one or more resolvers and each have a URL pattern that, for DRS-supporting systems, provides a URL template for making a successful DRS GET request.  For example, the DOI urlPattern is:

    urlPattern: "https://doi.org/{$id}"

If applicable, a provide code can be supplied in the above requests to specify a particular mirror if there are multiple resolvers for this namespace.  In the case of DOIs you only get a single resolver.

Given this information you now know you can make a GET on the URL:

    GET https://doi.org/10.5072/FK2805660V

_The URL above is valid for a DOI object but it is not actually a DRS server!  Instead, it redirects to a DRS server through a series of HTTP redirects.  This is likely to be common when working with existing compact identifiers like DOIs or Arks.  Regardless, the redirect should eventually lead to a DRS URL that percent-encodes the access as a DRS ID in a DRS object API call.  For a hypothetical example, here's what a redirect to a DRS API might look like for the Data GUIDs compact identifiers who host a DRS server._

    GET https://dataguids.org/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/dg.4503%2F00e6cfa9-a183-42f6-bb44-b70347106bbe

_IDs in DRS hostname-based URIs/URLs are always percent-encoded to eliminate ambiguity even though the DRS compact identifier-based URIs and the identifier.orgs API do not percent-encode accessions._  This was done in order to 1) follow the CURIE conventions of identifiers.org/n2t.net for compact identifier-based DRS URIs and 2) to aid in readability for users who understand they are working with compact identifiers. **The general rule of thumb, when using a compact identifier accession as a DRS ID in a DRS API call, make sure to percent-encode it.  An easy way to handle this is to get the initial DRS object JSON response from whatever redirects the compact identifier resolves to, then look for the `self_uri` in the JSON which will give you the correctly percent-encoded DRS ID for subsequent DRS API calls such as the access method.**
****

.Note: Registering a new Compact Identifier
****
See the documentation on https://n2t.net/e/compact_ids.html[n2t.net] and https://docs.identifiers.org/[identifiers.org] for. You can register new prefixes (or mirrors by adding resource provider codes) for free using a simple online form.  Keep in mind, while anyone can register prefixes, the identifiers.org/n2t.net sites do basic hand curation to verify new prefix and resource (provider code) requests.  See those sites for more details on their security practices.
****

.Note: Caching and Security with Compact Identifiers
****
As mentioned earlier identifiers.org/n2t.net resolver records do not change frequently.  This approach is  useful for caching resolver records and their URL patterns for performance reasons.  Builders of systems that use compact identifier-based DRS URIs should cache prefix resolver records from identifiers.org/n2t.net and occasionally refresh the records (such as every 24 hours).  The implementation of this approach is up to the system builder but it will ultimately reduce the burden on identifiers.org/n2t.net.  System builders may also choose to cache the compact identifier accession to final DRS URL records as well, but that decision/design is at the discretion of the system builder.

As mentioned earlier identifiers.org/n2t.net performs some basic verification of new prefixes and provider code mirror registrations on their sites.  However, system builders may have certain compliance requirements and regulations that prohibit relying on an external site for resolving compact identifiers.  In this case, systems under these security and compliance constraints may which to either whitelist certain compact identifier resolvers and/or vet records from identifiers.org/n2t.net before enabling in their system.

== Appendix: Hostname-Based URIs

.Note: DRS Client Hostname-Based URI Resolution Process
****
Strings of the form `drs://<hostname>/<id>` mean _“you can fetch the content with DRS id `<id>` from the DRS server at `<hostname>` "_.  For example, if a WES server was asked to process:

    drs://drs.example.org/314159

It would know that it could issue a GET request to:

    https://drs.example.org/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/314159

to learn how to fetch that data object via one of the available access approaches.

The protocol is always https and the port is always the standard 443 SSL port.  It would be invalid to include, for example, a different port in the DRS hostname-based URI.

In hostname-based DRS URIs, the ID is always percent-encoded to ensure special characters do not interfere with subsequent DRS endpoint calls.  As such, ":" is not allowed in the URI and is a convenient way of differentiating from a compact identifier-based DRS URI.  Also, if a given DRS service implementation uses compact identifier accessions as their DRS IDs, they must be percent encoded before using them as DRS IDs in hostname-based DRS URIs.
****

.Note: Service Registry/Info and Future Versions of DRS
****
In the future, as newer major versions of DRS are released, the ability to look at a hostname-based DRS URI and derive a valid GET URL will not be possible.  Multiple versions of DRS on different URL paths may be supported on the same server.  We expect to add support for https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-registry[service-registry] and https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-info[service-info] endpoints in future releases of DRS.  Using the hostname in the DRS URI, plus information in the service-registry standard endpoint (which lead to service-info endpoints on that server) a client will be able to discover enough information to translate a DRS hostname-based URI into a valid URL.  For, now we assume a rules-based translation to the pattern `https://<hostname>/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/<id>`

|Data sharing requires portable data, consistent with the FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). Today’s researchers and clinicians are surrounded by potentially useful data, but often need bespoke tools and processes to work with each dataset. Today’s data publishers don’t have a reliable way to make their data useful to all (and only) the people they choose. And today’s data controllers are tasked with implementing standard controls of non-standard mechanisms for data access.

_Figure 1: there’s an ocean of data, with many different tools to drink from it, but no guarantee that any tool will work with any subset of the data_

[cols="40a,60a"]

|We need a standard way for data producers to make their data available to data consumers, that supports the control needs of the former and the access needs of the latter. And we need it to be interoperable, so anyone who builds access tools and systems can be confident they'll work with all the data out there, and anyone who publishes data can be confident it will work with all the tools out there.

|We envision a world where:

* there are many many **data consumers**, working in research and in care, who can use the tools of their choice to access any and all data that they have permission to see
* there are many **data access tools** and platforms, supporting discovery, visualization, analysis, and collaboration
* there are many **data repositories**, each with their own policies and characteristics, which can be accessed by a variety of tools
* there are many **data publishing tools** and platforms, supporting a variety of data lifecycles and formats
* there are many many **data producers**, generating data of all types, who can use the tools of their choice to make their data as widely available as is appropriate

|image::figure3.png[]
_Figure 3: a standard Data Repository API enables an ecosystem of data producers and consumers_
|===

This spec defines a standard **Data Repository Service (DRS) API** (“the yellow box”), to enable that ecosystem of data producers and consumers. Our goal is that the only thing data consumers need to know about a data repo is _"here's the DRS endpoint to access it"_, and the only thing data publishers need to know to tap into the world of consumption tools is _"here's how to tell it where my DRS endpoint lives"_.

=== Federation

The world's biomedical data is controlled by groups with very different policies and restrictions on where their data lives and how it can be accessed. A primary purpose of DRS is to support unified access to disparate and distributed data. (As opposed to the alternative centralized model of "let's just bring all the data into one single data repository”, which would be technically easier but is no more realistic than “let’s just bring all the websites into one single web host”.)

In a DRS-enabled world, tool builders don’t have to worry about where the data their tools operate on lives -- they can count on DRS to give them access. And tool users only need to know which DRS server is managing the data they need, and whether they have permission to access it; they don’t have to worry about how to physically get access to, or (worse) make a copy of the data. For example, if I have appropriate permissions, I can run a pooled analysis where I run a single tool across data managed by different DRS servers, potentially in different locations.
