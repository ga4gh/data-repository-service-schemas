== Appendix: Compact Identifiers

Compact identifiers refer to locally-unique persistent identifiers that have been namespaced to provide global uniqueness. See https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/101279v3["Uniform resolution of compact identifiers for biomedical data"] for an excellent introduction to this topic.  We support the use of compact identifiers in DRS URIs since many resources in the research community issue these identifiers in a variety of formats.

When combined with the resolver registry services of https://identifiers.org/[identifiers.org] or https://n2t.net/[n2t.net (Name-To-Thing)], we can support any registered form of compact identifiers (Arks, DOIs, Data GUIDs, etc) and also allow for the resolution of DRS objects without needing to use a hostname in the URI.  By using compact identifiers with a resolver registry, systems using DRS URIs can identify the current resolver when needed. This allows a project to issue compact identifiers in DRS URIs and not be concerned if the project name or DRS hostname change in the future since the current resolver can always be found through the identifiers.org/n2t.net registries.  Together the identifiers.org/n2t.net systems support the resolver lookup for over 700 compact identifiers formats used in the research community.

To make this work we leverage the CURIE format used by identifiers.org/n2t.net.  Compact identifiers have the form:

    prefix:accession

The prefix can be divided into an optional provider code and the namespace.  The accession here is an Ark, DOI, Data GUID, or another issuers's local ID for the object being pointed to:

    [provider_code/]namespace:accession

Both the provider code and namespace disallow spaces or punctuation, only lowercase alphanumerical characters, underscores and dots are allowed.

https://n2t.net/e/compact_ids.html[Examples] include (from n2t.net):

		PDB:2gc4
		Taxon:9606
		DOI:10.5281/ZENODO.1289856
		ark:/47881/m6g15z54
		IGSN:SSH000SUA

TIP: DRS URIs using compact identifiers with resolvers registered in identifiers.org/n2t.net can be distinguished from the hostname-based DRS URIs below based on the required ":" which is not allowed in hostname-based URI.

TIP: The CURIE format used by identifiers.org/n2t.net does not percent-encode reserved URI characters but, instead, relies on the first ":" character to separate prefix from accession. Since these accessions can contain any characters, and characters like "/" will interfere with DRS API calls, you _must_ percent encode the accessions extracted from DRS compact identifier-based URIs when using them in DRS GET requests.  For more information see the Note "DRS Client Compact Identifier Resolution Process" below.

See the documentation on https://n2t.net/e/compact_ids.html[n2t.net] and https://docs.identifiers.org/[identifiers.org] for much more information on the compact identifiers used there and details about the resolution process. You can also register new prefixes (or mirrors by adding resource providers) for free using a simple online form.  Keep in mind, while anyone can register prefixes, the identifiers.org/n2t.net sites do basic hand curation to verify new prefix and resource (provider code) requests.  See those sites for more details on their security practices.

== Appendix: Service Registry and Service Info

.Note: Service Registry/Info and Future Versions of DRS
****
In the future, as newer major versions of DRS are released, the ability to look at a hostname-based DRS URI and derive a valid GET URL will not be possible.  Multiple versions of DRS on different URL paths may be supported on the same server.  We expect to add support for https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-registry[service-registry] and https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-service-info[service-info] in future releases of DRS.  Using the hostname in the DRS URI, plus information in the service-registry standard endpoint (which lead to service-info endpoints on that server) a client will be able to discover enough information to translate a DRS hostname-based URI into a valid URL.  For now we assume a rules-based translation to `https://<hostname>/ga4gh/drs/v1/objects/<id>`

|Data sharing requires portable data, consistent with the FAIR data principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). Today’s researchers and clinicians are surrounded by potentially useful data, but often need bespoke tools and processes to work with each dataset. Today’s data publishers don’t have a reliable way to make their data useful to all (and only) the people they choose. And today’s data controllers are tasked with implementing standard controls of non-standard mechanisms for data access.

|We need a standard way for data producers to make their data available to data consumers, that supports the control needs of the former and the access needs of the latter. And we need it to be interoperable, so anyone who builds access tools and systems can be confident they'll work with all the data out there, and anyone who publishes data can be confident it will work with all the tools out there.

|We envision a world where:

* there are many many **data consumers**, working in research and in care, who can use the tools of their choice to access any and all data that they have permission to see
* there are many **data access tools** and platforms, supporting discovery, visualization, analysis, and collaboration
* there are many **data repositories**, each with their own policies and characteristics, which can be accessed by a variety of tools
* there are many **data publishing tools** and platforms, supporting a variety of data lifecycles and formats
* there are many many **data producers**, generating data of all types, who can use the tools of their choice to make their data as widely available as is appropriate

_Figure 3: a standard Data Repository API enables an ecosystem of data producers and consumers_
|===

This spec defines a standard **Data Repository Service (DRS) API** (“the yellow box”), to enable that ecosystem of data producers and consumers. Our goal is that the only thing data consumers need to know about a data repo is _"here's the DRS endpoint to access it"_, and the only thing data publishers need to know to tap into the world of consumption tools is _"here's how to tell it where my DRS endpoint lives"_.

=== Federation

The world's biomedical data is controlled by groups with very different policies and restrictions on where their data lives and how it can be accessed. A primary purpose of DRS is to support unified access to disparate and distributed data. (As opposed to the alternative centralized model of "let's just bring all the data into one single data repository”, which would be technically easier but is no more realistic than “let’s just bring all the websites into one single web host”.)

In a DRS-enabled world, tool builders don’t have to worry about where the data their tools operate on lives -- they can count on DRS to give them access. And tool users only need to know which DRS server is managing the data they need, and whether they have permission to access it; they don’t have to worry about how to physically get access to, or (worse) make a copy of the data. For example, if I have appropriate permissions, I can run a pooled analysis where I run a single tool across data managed by different DRS servers, potentially in different locations.
