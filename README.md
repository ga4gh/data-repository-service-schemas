# About the GA4GH Cloud Work Stream

The GA4GH [Cloud Work Stream](https://ga4gh.cloud) helps the genomics and health communities take full advantage of modern cloud environments.
Our initial focus is on “bringing the algorithms to the data”, by creating standards for defining, sharing, and executing portable workflows.

We work with platform development partners and industry leaders to develop standards that will facilitate interoperability.

# What is DRS?

The Data Repository Service (DRS) API provides a generic interface to data repositories so data consumers, including workflow systems, can access data in a single, standard way regardless of where it’s stored and how it’s managed.
The primary functionality of DRS is to map a logical ID to a means for physically retrieving the data represented by the ID.
